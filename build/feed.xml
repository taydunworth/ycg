  <itunes:subtitle>Not only do we have a new episode for you, but we have terrible jokes in it as well! This week, we correct our ever so wrong guess at the new Regi raid boss, but guess what? Registeel is just as boring as Regirock, so we spend more time getting excited about the Alola raid bosses instead and ponder who is giving Raichu all of these pancakes!? We also have a new update in Pokémon GO involving friend list sorting and lucky Pokémon, which Taylor has been unlucky with getting. Lastly, we get excited about Raikou and reminisce on the Zapdos Hours.
